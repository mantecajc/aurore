<h1>Studio L’Aurore</h1>
<p>A simple and minimal set up with all what you need to express your creativity.</p>

<p>A mix of old analog instruments and preamps with the simplicity of a digital mixing process.</p>

<p>As an acoustician I’m really picky with the sound of the room, adding to a precise monitoring system and a good pair of ears, L’Aurore delivers some polish mixes matching the high quality standards for any of your projects.</p>
